Google Chrome lets you create shortcuts from your tabs that function similarly to desktop apps. 

Click the triple dot menu icon -> `More Tools` -> `Create Shortcut...` -> `Open as window` -> `OK`

Now your tab can be viewed as a separate app. In the image below I have Hacker News, Jira, Google Calendar,
Gmail and even this site as apps.

All apps that are created can be viewed by navigating to `chrome://apps/`
