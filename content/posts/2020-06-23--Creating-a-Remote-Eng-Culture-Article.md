Millions of people began working remotely this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, a lot has changed in the way we work, interact,
and communicate with our coworkers. I have never worked remotely before so it has been quite a challenging, but interesting, experience.

After a couple months, the engineering team at Policygenius had adjusted to working from home and was able to work
effectively to build great products. However, it wasn't easy to adapt to this new way of life. Our entire culture prior to this was built around
being in the office. We put in a ton of effort to ensure we kept that same incredible engineering culture alive.

I took the time to reflect on how our engineering team made the huge shift from having no remote employees to every single person working remotely.
Many companies and organizations might also have had adapt to this new world, so I decided to write an article outlining how the team at Policygenius created a remote
engineering culture and the lessons learned along the way.
